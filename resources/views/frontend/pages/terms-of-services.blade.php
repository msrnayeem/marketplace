                    <h1 class="mt-4">Key Terms</h1>

                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Gig® Page</strong> is where the Seller can describe their Gig and the Gig’s
                        terms, and the

                        Packages can include upgrades, which lets Sellers price their service for a basic price of over $5.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Buyers</strong> are individuals who acquire services on Fiverr.</p>

                    <p><strong>Orders</strong> are formal agreements established between a Buyer and a Seller after a
                        purchase has been made

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Overview (Main Terms, in a nutshell)</h2>
                    <ul class="mt-2">
                        <li>Only registered users may buy and sell on Fiverr. Registration is free.
                        </li>
                        <li>In registering for an account, you agree to provide us with accurate,
                            complete and updated information and must not create an account for fraudulent or misleading
                            purposes.</li>
                        <li>You are solely responsible for any activity on your account and for
                            maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password. We are not liable for any acts or
                            omissions by you in connection with your account.</li>
                        <li>Gigs on Fiverr may be offered at a base starting price of $5. Some Gigs
                            are offered at a base price of more than $5 as determined by the Seller.</li>
                        <li>Buyers pay Fiverr in advance to create an order (see Payment Terms).
                        </li>
                        <li>Orders are purchased through the Order button found on a Seller’s Gig
                            page or through a Custom Offer.</li>
                        <li>For fees and payments please read the Payment Terms.</li>
                        <li>Sellers must fulfill their orders, and may not cancel orders on a
                            regular basis or without cause. Cancelling orders will affect Sellers’ reputation and status.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sellers gain account statuses (Levels) based on their performance and
                            reputation. Advanced levels provide their owners with benefits, including offering services for
                            higher prices through Gig Extras, or selling their Gig in multiples.</li>
                        <li>Users may not offer or accept payments using any method other than
                            placing an order through Fiverr.com.</li>
                        <li>When purchasing a Gig, Buyers are granted all rights for the delivered
                            work, unless otherwise specified by the Seller on their Gig page. Note: some Gigs charge
                            additional payments (through Gig Extras) for Commercial Use License. See our “Ownership” and
                            “Commercial Use License” sections below for more information.</li>
                        <li>Fiverr retains the right to use all published delivered works and Logo
                            Designs for Fiverr marketing and promotion purposes.</li>
                        <li>We care about your privacy. You can read our Privacy Policy <a href="link-to-privacy-policy"
                                class="btn btn-link">here</a>.</li>
                        <li>Users undertake to comply with Fiverr’s Community Standards, which are a
                            set of behavior rules and guidelines, applicable to the Fiverr community and marketplace in
                            addition to these Terms of Service, as updated from time to time.</li>
                        <li>Fiverr offers its users the Logo Maker, which allows certain Sellers to
                            offer various original logo designs for Buyers to adjust and customize per their own specific
                            needs, using special automated design tools. Through the Logo Maker, Buyers purchase full
                            commercial use rights to the Logo Design embedded with their brand name.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Sellers</h2>
                    <h2 class="mt-4">Basics</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sellers create Gigs on Fiverr to allow Buyers to purchase their services.</li>
                        <li>Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their Gigs.</li>
                        <li>Each Gig you sell and successfully complete, accredits your account with a revenue equal to 80%
                            of the purchase amount.</li>
                        <li>Fiverr accredits Sellers once an order is completed. See our "Orders" section below for a
                            definition of a completed order.</li>
                        <li>For more information about receiving payments, fees, and taxes, see the Payment Terms.</li>
                        <li>Sellers may not promote their Gigs or any Fiverr content via the Google Ads platform.</li>
                        <li>The Seller's rating is calculated based on the order reviews posted by Buyers or Pro Account
                            Team Members (for Fiverr Pro). High ratings allow Sellers to obtain advanced Seller levels (see
                            Levels below). In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the
                            Seller’s account.</li>
                        <li>For security concerns, Fiverr may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to
                            prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper
                            behavior reported by other users, or associating multiple Fiverr accounts to a single withdrawal
                            provider.</li>
                        <li>Sellers are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts
                            that are sufficient to cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <li>7 Gigs for Sellers without a Level status.</li>
                            <li>10 Gigs for Level 1 Sellers.</li>
                            <li>20 Gigs for Level 2 Sellers.</li>
                            <li>30 Gigs for Top Rated Sellers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Gigs created on Fiverr are considered User Generated Content.</li>

                            and cannot be restored or edited.</li>
                        <li>Gigs may also be removed due to poor performance and/or user misconduct.</li>
                        <li>Gigs must include an appropriate Gig image related to the service offered, and Sellers must
                            deliver the same quality of service as shown in their Gig images.</li>
                        <li>Gigs may contain an approved Gig Video uploaded through the Gig management tools available
                            on Fiverr.</li>
                        <li>Statements on the Gig Page that undermine or circumvent these Terms of Service are
                            prohibited.</li>
                        <li>Eligible Gigs in select Categories may set up Gig Packages with multiple price points for
                            structured services.</li>
                        <li>Certain categories are available only to Pro Freelancers; creating a Gig for services
                            available to Pros only may result in Gig removal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="mt-4">Gig® Extras</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gig Extras are additional services offered on top of the Seller's Gig for an extra price set
                            by the Seller.</li>
                        <li>Gig Extras may be removed for violations of Fiverr's Terms of Service and/or Community

                        <li>The number and price of Gig Extras are based on your Seller Level. Details on eligibility
                            can be found <a href="link-to-eligibility">here</a>.</li>
                        <li>Services offered through Gig Extras must be related to the base service and part of the

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Levels</h2>

                    <p>Fiverr is a platform that helps sellers grow their businesses by providing them
                        with helpful tools and opportunities. Sellers who invest in self-promotion and
                        deliver high-quality work on time may be rewarded with new statuses,
                        special benefits, and tools.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sellers can achieve different account Levels based on their activity,
                            performance, and reputation. The criteria for advancement can be found <a

                        <li>Advancement in Levels is periodically updated by an automated system.

                        <li>The available Levels for Sellers are Level 1, Level 2, and Top Rated.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sellers who fail to maintain high-quality service, experience a
                            significant drop in ratings, or consistently miss deadlines may risk losing their Seller status
                            and associated benefits. This includes late deliveries, account warnings, and cancellations,
                            which can result in a change in Level.</li>
                        <li>Advanced Levels offer additional benefits, such as the ability to offer

                                ratings, outstanding customer service, a high order completion rate, and community
                                leadership.

                                <li>Sellers earn a 20% share of the fees directly charged for standard license Stock Media.
                                    Fiverr may offer Buyers the option to upgrade their standard license after purchase, but
                                    Sellers do not receive additional revenue from these upgrades.</li>
                                <li><strong>Important:</strong> Each selected Stock Media item is licensed for a single use
                                    and should be integrated into the delivered work. Sellers are prohibited from sharing
                                    the original image file with the Buyer or any third party. Stock Media is also governed
                                    by specific license terms established by Shutterstock. For the complete Stock Media
                                    license terms, please refer to <a href="stock-media-license-terms">this link</a>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Important:</strong> If you cancel an Order that includes Stock Media, the
                                    license for that Stock Media will also be canceled, and you will no longer be able to
                                    use it.</li>
                                <li>Please note that Stock Media is available for purchase by everyone and is not

                                <li>Some Gigs on Fiverr involve physical delivery (e.g., arts and crafts, collectible
                                    items). For these Gigs, Sellers may choose to include a shipping cost.</li>
                                <li>If a Gig includes a shipping cost, it means that physical items must be sent to the
                                    Buyer.</li>
                                <li>The shipping cost associated with a Gig covers the expenses Sellers incur for shipping
                                    physical items to Buyers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Important:</strong> Buyers who purchase Gigs requiring physical delivery will be
                                    prompted to provide their shipping address.</li>
                                <li>Sellers are responsible for handling all shipping arrangements once the Buyer has
                                    provided the shipping address.</li>
                                <li>Fiverr does not oversee or guarantee the shipping process, including tracking, item
                                    quality, condition, or delivery. As such, Fiverr is not responsible or liable for any
                                    issues or damages resulting from shipping.</li>
                                <li>A tracking number is a great way to avoid disputes related to shipping.
                                    We require entering the tracking number if available in the Order
                                    Page when delivering your work.</li>

                                    described in these Terms of Service. Using the “Deliver Work” button when an Order was
                                    not fulfilled may result in a cancellation of that Order after review, affect the

                                    complete if no acceptance or request for modification were submitted within 8 days after
                                    being marked as Delivered, however, in such case the Order will be stopped and all
                                    further milestones will not start. Once a milestone is delivered and accepted, Buyers
                                    may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next milestone, or to stop
                                    the Order. If Buyer does not pay for the next milestone within 10 days of acceptance of
                                    previous milestones, the Order under the next milestones will not start. Please note
                                    that if you choose to stop the future milestones, the current ordered milestone will not

                                <li>Buyers may purchase a Gig Subscription, if available on the Seller’s Gig page. During

                                    a recurring basis, as agreed between the Seller and Buyer. By purchasing a Gig
                                    Subscription, you authorize us to automatically charge you for each Order under the Gig

                            <h2 class="mt-4">Ownership</h2>
                            <p><strong>Ownership and limitations:</strong> When purchasing a Gig on Fiverr, unless clearly
                                stated otherwise on the Seller's Gig page/description, when the work is delivered, and
                                subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not
                                limited to, copyright in the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and
                                all moral rights therein. Accordingly, the Seller expressly assigns to the Buyer the
                                copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to the
                                Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the Gig, and the delivery may not be used if
                                payment is canceled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as
                                art work, design work, report generation etc.), the delivered work and its copyright shall
                                be the exclusive property of the Buyer and, upon delivery, the Seller agrees that it
                                thereby, pursuant to these <strong>Terms of Service</strong>, assigns all right, title and
                                interest in and to the delivered work to the Buyer. Some Gigs (including for custom created
                                work) charge additional payments (through Gig Extras) for a Commercial Use License. This
                                means that if you purchase the Gig for personal use, you will own all rights you require for
                                such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License. If you intend to use it for any
                                charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or indirectly in
                                connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy
                                the Commercial Use License through a Gig Extra and will have broader rights that cover your
                                business use.</p>

                            <p><strong>Ownership and Rights:</strong> When you make a purchase on Fiverr, unless explicitly
                                stated otherwise on the Seller's Gig page or description, you are granted all intellectual
                                property rights, including copyright, for the work delivered by the Seller. This ownership
                                is transferred to you, the Buyer, upon delivery and upon completion of payment. The Seller
                                also relinquishes any moral rights they may have in the work. It's important to note that
                                this transfer of intellectual property rights is contingent upon full payment for the Gig.
                                If payment is canceled for any reason, you cannot use the delivered work.</p>

                            <p>In cases of custom-created work, such as artwork, design, or report generation, the delivered
                                work and its copyright become the exclusive property of the Buyer upon delivery. The Seller,
                                in accordance with these Terms of Service, assigns all rights, titles, and interests in the
                                delivered work to the Buyer.</p>

                            <p>For Voice Over Gigs, when the work is delivered and payment is made, the Buyer acquires basic
                                rights, allowing them to use the work indefinitely and for any purpose except for
                                commercials, radio, television, and internet commercial spots. If you intend to use the
                                Voice Over for promotional purposes or in commercial contexts, additional rights known as
                                Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) or Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) must be purchased through Gig
                                Extras. For more information on these types of rights, please refer to the details below.
                            </p>

                            <p>Furthermore, all users, whether Buyers or Sellers, agree that unless explicitly specified
                                otherwise, any content they voluntarily create or upload to Fiverr, including Gig texts,
                                photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos, and any other information, including
                                the display of delivered work, may be used by Fiverr for marketing and other purposes,
                                without any compensation.</p>
