                    a European data protection perspective, such as the United States. With regard to data transfers to such

                        conduct business in California; (2) provide proof of such registration; and (3) provide
                        documentation or other proof indicating that they are authorized to act on your behalf. We may also
                        require you to verify your identity directly with us, and directly confirm with us that you provided
                        the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-3">To make such requests, we kindly ask that you open a Customer Relations ticket here: <a
